# One Button Games
This repository holds all one button games for the one button arcade machine.  
If you want to contribute a game, submit a pull request or talk to us directly.  

## Submission
You should add only one folder for your game.  
That folder should contain:  
- An executable to play your game. It should be named **game.exe**!
- An image to display your game. It should be named **image.jpg**!  
- A README file with some additional infos structured as below. It should be named **README.md**!

### Structure for the README
The README file should be structured as follows:
- First line should start with a **#** and follow with the title of the game (e.g. *# My Great Game*)  
- Second line should contain the description of the game.  

#### Example README
```
# My Great Game
In "My Great Game" you play my great game! :)
```
